For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n   *\n   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n   *\n   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n   *\n   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n   *\n   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n   *\n   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n   *\n   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n   * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n   * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n   *\n   *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n   *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n   *     }\n   *\n   * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   */\n  function is(valueA, valueB) {\n    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\n      valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n      valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n      if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n        return true;\n      }\n      if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n        return false;\n      }\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.equals === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.equals === 'function' &&\n        valueA.equals(valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  function deepEqual(a, b) {\n    if (a === b) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    if (\n      !isIterable(b) ||\n      a.size !== undefined && b.size !== undefined && a.size !== b.size ||\n      a.__hash !== undefined && b.__hash !== undefined && a.__hash !== b.__hash ||\n      isKeyed(a) !== isKeyed(b) ||\n      isIndexed(a) !== isIndexed(b) ||\n      isOrdered(a) !== isOrdered(b)\n    ) {\n      return false;\n    }\n\n    if (a.size === 0 && b.size === 0) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    var notAssociative = !isAssociative(a);\n\n    if (isOrdered(a)) {\n      var entries = a.entries();\n      return b.every(function(v, k)  {\n        var entry = entries.next().value;\n        return entry && is(entry[1], v) && (notAssociative || is(entry[0], k));\n      }) && entries.next().done;\n    }\n\n    var flipped = false;\n\n    if (a.size === undefined) {\n      if (b.size === undefined) {\n        if (typeof a.cacheResult === 'function') {\n          a.cacheResult();\n        }\n      } else {\n        flipped = true;\n        var _ = a;\n        a = b;\n        b = _;\n      }\n    }\n\n    var allEqual = true;\n    var bSize = b.__iterate(function(v, k)  {\n      if (notAssociative ? !a.has(v) :\n          flipped ? !is(v, a.get(k, NOT_SET)) : !is(a.get(k, NOT_SET), v)) {\n        allEqual = false;\n        return false;\n      }\n    });\n\n    return allEqual && a.size === bSize;\n  }\n\n  createClass(Repeat, IndexedSeq);\n\n    function Repeat(value, times) {\n      if (!(this instanceof Repeat)) {\n        return new Repeat(value, times);\n      }\n      this._value = value;\n      this.size = times === undefined ?

For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n   *\n   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n   *\n   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n   *\n   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n   *\n   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n   *\n   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n   *\n   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n   * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n   * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n   *\n   *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n   *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n   *     }\n   *\n   * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   */\n  function is(valueA, valueB) {\n    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\n      valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n      valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n      if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n        return true;\n      }\n      if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n        return false;\n      }\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.equals === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.equals === 'function' &&\n        valueA.equals(valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  function deepEqual(a, b) {\n    if (a === b) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    if (\n      !isIterable(b) ||\n      a.size !== undefined && b.size !== undefined && a.size !== b.size ||\n      a.__hash !== undefined && b.__hash !== undefined && a.__hash !== b.__hash ||\n      isKeyed(a) !== isKeyed(b) ||\n      isIndexed(a) !== isIndexed(b) ||\n      isOrdered(a) !== isOrdered(b)\n    ) {\n      return false;\n    }\n\n    if (a.size === 0 && b.size === 0) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    var notAssociative = !isAssociative(a);\n\n    if (isOrdered(a)) {\n      var entries = a.entries();\n      return b.every(function(v, k)  {\n        var entry = entries.next().value;\n        return entry && is(entry[1], v) && (notAssociative || is(entry[0], k));\n      }) && entries.next().done;\n    }\n\n    var flipped = false;\n\n    if (a.size === undefined) {\n      if (b.size === undefined) {\n        if (typeof a.cacheResult === 'function') {\n          a.cacheResult();\n        }\n      } else {\n        flipped = true;\n        var _ = a;\n        a = b;\n        b = _;\n      }\n    }\n\n    var allEqual = true;\n    var bSize = b.__iterate(function(v, k)  {\n      if (notAssociative ? !a.has(v) :\n          flipped ? !is(v, a.get(k, NOT_SET)) : !is(a.get(k, NOT_SET), v)) {\n        allEqual = false;\n        return false;\n      }\n    });\n\n    return allEqual && a.size === bSize;\n  }\n\n  createClass(Repeat, IndexedSeq);\n\n    function Repeat(value, times) {\n      if (!(this instanceof Repeat)) {\n        return new Repeat(value, times);\n      }\n      this._value = value;\n      this.size = times === undefined ?

For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n   *\n   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n   *\n   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n   *\n   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n   *\n   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n   *\n   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n   *\n   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n   * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n   * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n   *\n   *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n   *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n   *     }\n   *\n   * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   */\n  function is(valueA, valueB) {\n    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\n      valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n      valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n      if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n        return true;\n      }\n      if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n        return false;\n      }\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.equals === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.equals === 'function' &&\n        valueA.equals(valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  function deepEqual(a, b) {\n    if (a === b) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    if (\n      !isIterable(b) ||\n      a.size !== undefined && b.size !== undefined && a.size !== b.size ||\n      a.__hash !== undefined && b.__hash !== undefined && a.__hash !== b.__hash ||\n      isKeyed(a) !== isKeyed(b) ||\n      isIndexed(a) !== isIndexed(b) ||\n      isOrdered(a) !== isOrdered(b)\n    ) {\n      return false;\n    }\n\n    if (a.size === 0 && b.size === 0) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    var notAssociative = !isAssociative(a);\n\n    if (isOrdered(a)) {\n      var entries = a.entries();\n      return b.every(function(v, k)  {\n        var entry = entries.next().value;\n        return entry && is(entry[1], v) && (notAssociative || is(entry[0], k));\n      }) && entries.next().done;\n    }\n\n    var flipped = false;\n\n    if (a.size === undefined) {\n      if (b.size === undefined) {\n        if (typeof a.cacheResult === 'function') {\n          a.cacheResult();\n        }\n      } else {\n        flipped = true;\n        var _ = a;\n        a = b;\n        b = _;\n      }\n    }\n\n    var allEqual = true;\n    var bSize = b.__iterate(function(v, k)  {\n      if (notAssociative ? !a.has(v) :\n          flipped ? !is(v, a.get(k, NOT_SET)) : !is(a.get(k, NOT_SET), v)) {\n        allEqual = false;\n        return false;\n      }\n    });\n\n    return allEqual && a.size === bSize;\n  }\n\n  createClass(Repeat, IndexedSeq);\n\n    function Repeat(value, times) {\n      if (!(this instanceof Repeat)) {\n        return new Repeat(value, times);\n      }\n      this._value = value;\n      this.size = times === undefined ?

Since TeX isn't context-free, standard parsers don't work particularly\n * well.\n *\n * The strategy of this parser is as such:\n *\n * The main functions (the `.parse...` ones) take a position in the current\n * parse string to parse tokens from. The lexer (found in Lexer.js, stored at\n * this.lexer) also supports pulling out tokens at arbitrary places. When\n * individual tokens are needed at a position, the lexer is called to pull out a\n * token, which is then used.\n *\n * The parser has a property called \"mode\" indicating the mode that\n * the parser is currently in. Currently it has to be one of \"math\" or\n * \"text\", which denotes whether the current environment is a math-y\n * one or a text-y one (e.g. inside \\text). Currently, this serves to\n * limit the functions which can be used in text mode.\n *\n * The main functions then return an object which contains the useful data that\n * was parsed at its given point, and a new position at the end of the parsed\n * data. The main functions can call each other and continue the parsing by\n * using the returned position as a new starting point.\n *\n * There are also extra `.handle...` functions, which pull out some reused\n * functionality into self-contained functions.\n *\n * The earlier functions return ParseNodes.\n * The later functions (which are called deeper in the parse) sometimes return\n * ParseFuncOrArgument, which contain a ParseNode as well as some data about\n * whether the parsed object is a function which is missing some arguments, or a\n * standalone object which can be used as an argument to another function.\n */\n\n/**\n * An initial function (without its arguments), or an argument to a function.\n * The `result` argument should be a ParseNode.\n */\nfunction ParseFuncOrArgument(result, isFunction, token) {\n    this.result = result;\n    // Is this a function (i.e. is it something defined in functions.js)?\n    this.isFunction = isFunction;\n    this.token = token;\n} /* eslint no-constant-condition:0 */\n\nvar Parser = function () {\n    function Parser(input, settings) {\n        (0, _classCallCheck3.default)(this, Parser);\n\n        // Create a new macro expander (gullet) and (indirectly via that) also a\n        // new lexer (mouth) for this parser (stomach, in the language of TeX)\n        this.gullet = new _MacroExpander2.default(input, settings.macros);\n        // Use old \\color behavior (same as LaTeX's \\textcolor) if requested.\n        // We do this after the macros object has been copied by MacroExpander.\n        if (settings.colorIsTextColor) {\n            this.gullet.macros[\"\\\\color\"] = \"\\\\textcolor\";\n        }\n        // Store the settings for use in parsing\n        this.settings = settings;\n        // Count leftright depth (for \\middle errors)\n        this.leftrightDepth = 0;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Checks a result to make sure it has the right type, and throws an\n     * appropriate error otherwise.\n     *\n     * @param {boolean=} consume whether to consume the expected token,\n     *                           defaults to true\n     */\n\n\n    (0, _createClass3.default)(Parser, [{\n        key: \"expect\",\n        value: function expect(text, consume) {\n            if (this.nextToken.text !== text) {\n                throw new _ParseError2.default(\"Expected '\" + text + \"', got '\" + this.nextToken.text + \"'\", this.nextToken);\n            }\n            if (consume !== false) {\n                this.consume();\n            }\n        }\n\n        /**\n         * Considers the current look ahead token as consumed,\n         * and fetches the one after that as the new look ahead.\n         */\n\n    }, {\n        key: \"consume\",\n        value: function consume() {\n            this.nextToken = this.gullet.get(this.mode === \"math\");\n        }\n    }, {\n        key: \"switchMode\",\n        value: function switchMode(newMode) {\n            this.gullet.unget(this.nextToken);\n            this.mode = newMode;\n            this.consume();\n        }\n\n        /**\n         * Main parsing function, which parses an entire input.\n         *\n         * @return {?Array.<ParseNode>}\n         */\n\n    }, {\n        key: \"parse\",\n        value: function parse() {\n            // Try to parse the input\n            this.mode = \"math\";\n            this.consume();\n            var parse = this.parseInput();\n            return parse;\n        }\n\n        /**\n         * Parses an entire input tree.\n         */\n\n    }, {\n        key: \"parseInput\",\n        value: function parseInput() {\n            // Parse an expression\n            var expression = this.parseExpression(false);\n            // If we succeeded, make sure there's an EOF at the end\n            this.expect(\"EOF\", false);\n            return expression;\n        }\n    }, {\n        key: \"parseExpression\",\n\n\n        /**\n         * Parses an \"expression\", which is a list of atoms.\n         *\n         * @param {boolean} breakOnInfix  Should the parsing stop when we hit infix\n         *                  nodes?

* The first argument to defineFunction is a single name or a list of names.\n * All functions named in such a list will share a single implementation.\n *\n * Each declared function can have associated properties, which\n * include the following:\n *\n *  - numArgs: The number of arguments the function takes.\n *             If this is the only property, it can be passed as a number\n *             instead of an element of a properties object.\n *  - argTypes: (optional) An array corresponding to each argument of the\n *              function, giving the type of argument that should be parsed. Its\n *              length should be equal to `numArgs + numOptionalArgs`. Valid\n *              types:\n *               - \"size\": A size-like thing, such as \"1em\" or \"5ex\"\n *               - \"color\": An html color, like \"#abc\" or \"blue\"\n *               - \"original\": The same type as the environment that the\n *                             function being parsed is in (e.g. used for the\n *                             bodies of functions like \\textcolor where the\n *                             first argument is special and the second\n *                             argument is parsed normally)\n *              Other possible types (probably shouldn't be used)\n *               - \"text\": Text-like (e.g. \\text)\n *               - \"math\": Normal math\n *              If undefined, this will be treated as an appropriate length\n *              array of \"original\" strings\n *  - greediness: (optional) The greediness of the function to use ungrouped\n *                arguments.\n *\n *                E.g. if you have an expression\n *                  \\sqrt \\frac 1 2\n *                since \\frac has greediness=2 vs \\sqrt's greediness=1, \\frac\n *                will use the two arguments '1' and '2' as its two arguments,\n *                then that whole function will be used as the argument to\n *                \\sqrt. On the other hand, the expressions\n *                  \\frac \\frac 1 2 3\n *                and\n *                  \\frac \\sqrt 1 2\n *                will fail because \\frac and \\frac have equal greediness\n *                and \\sqrt has a lower greediness than \\frac respectively. To\n *                make these parse, we would have to change them to:\n *                  \\frac {\\frac 1 2} 3\n *                and\n *                  \\frac {\\sqrt 1} 2\n *\n *                The default value is `1`\n *  - allowedInText: (optional) Whether or not the function is allowed inside\n *                   text mode (default false)\n *  - numOptionalArgs: (optional) The number of optional arguments the function\n *                     should parse. If the optional arguments aren't found,\n *                     `null` will be passed to the handler in their place.\n *                     (default 0)\n *  - infix: (optional) Must be true if the function is an infix operator.\n *\n * The last argument is that implementation, the handler for the function(s).\n * It is called to handle these functions and their arguments.\n * It receives two arguments:\n *  - context contains information and references provided by the parser\n *  - args is an array of arguments obtained from TeX input\n * The context contains the following properties:\n *  - funcName: the text (i.e. name) of the function, including \\\n *  - parser: the parser object\n *  - lexer: the lexer object\n *  - positions: the positions in the overall string of the function\n *               and the arguments.\n * The latter three should only be used to produce error messages.\n *\n * The function should return an object with the following keys:\n *  - type: The type of element that this is. This is then used in\n *          buildHTML/buildMathML to determine which function\n *          should be called to build this node into a DOM node\n * Any other data can be added to the object, which will be passed\n * in to the function in buildHTML/buildMathML as `group.value`.\n */\n\nfunction defineFunction(names, props, handler) {\n    if (typeof names === \"string\") {\n        names = [names];\n    }\n    if (typeof props === \"number\") {\n        props = { numArgs: props };\n    }\n    // Set default values of functions\n    var data = {\n        numArgs: props.numArgs,\n        argTypes: props.argTypes,\n        greediness: props.greediness === undefined ? 1 : props.greediness,\n        allowedInText: !!props.allowedInText,\n        allowedInMath: props.allowedInMath,\n        numOptionalArgs: props.numOptionalArgs || 0,\n        infix: !!props.infix,\n        handler: handler\n    };\n    for (var i = 0; i < names.length; ++i) {\n        module.exports[names[i]] = data;\n    }\n}\n\n// Since the corresponding buildHTML/buildMathML function expects a\n// list of elements, we normalize for different kinds of arguments\nvar ordargument = function ordargument(arg) {\n    if (arg.type === \"ordgroup\") {\n        return arg.value;\n    } else {\n        return [arg];\n    }\n};\n\n// A normal square root\ndefineFunction(\"\\\\sqrt\", {\n    numArgs: 1,\n    numOptionalArgs: 1\n}, function (context, args) {\n    var index = args[0];\n    var body = args[1];\n    return {\n        type: \"sqrt\",\n        body: body,\n        index: index\n    };\n});\n\n// Non-mathy text, possibly in a font\nvar textFunctionStyles = {\n    \"\\\\text\": undefined, \"\\\\textrm\": \"mathrm\", \"\\\\textsf\": \"mathsf\",\n    \"\\\\texttt\": \"mathtt\", \"\\\\textnormal\": \"mathrm\", \"\\\\textbf\": \"mathbf\",\n    \"\\\\textit\": \"textit\"\n};\n\ndefineFunction([\"\\\\text\", \"\\\\textrm\", \"\\\\textsf\", \"\\\\texttt\", \"\\\\textnormal\", \"\\\\textbf\", \"\\\\textit\"], {\n    numArgs: 1,\n    argTypes: [\"text\"],\n    greediness: 2,\n    allowedInText: true\n}, function (context, args) {\n    var body = args[0];\n    return {\n        type: \"text\",\n        body: ordargument(body),\n        style: textFunctionStyles[context.funcName]\n    };\n});\n\n// A two-argument custom color\ndefineFunction(\"\\\\textcolor\", {\n    numArgs: 2,\n    allowedInText: true,\n    greediness: 3,\n    argTypes: [\"color\", \"original\"]\n}, function (context, args) {\n    var color = args[0];\n    var body = args[1];\n    return {\n        type: \"color\",\n        color: color.value,\n        value: ordargument(body)\n    };\n});\n\n// \\color is handled in Parser.js's parseImplicitGroup\ndefineFunction(\"\\\\color\", {\n    numArgs: 1,\n    allowedInText: true,\n    greediness: 3,\n    argTypes: [\"color\"]\n}, null);\n\n// An overline\ndefineFunction(\"\\\\overline\", {\n    numArgs: 1\n}, function (context, args) {\n    var body = args[0];\n    return {\n        type: \"overline\",\n        body: body\n    };\n});\n\n// An underline\ndefineFunction(\"\\\\underline\", {\n    numArgs: 1\n}, function (context, args) {\n    var body = args[0];\n    return {\n        type: \"underline\",\n        body: body\n    };\n});\n\n// A box of the width and height\ndefineFunction(\"\\\\rule\", {\n    numArgs: 2,\n    numOptionalArgs: 1,\n    argTypes: [\"size\", \"size\", \"size\"]\n}, function (context, args) {\n    var shift = args[0];\n    var width = args[1];\n    var height = args[2];\n    return {\n        type: \"rule\",\n        shift: shift && shift.value,\n        width: width.value,\n        height: height.value\n    };\n});\n\n// TODO: In TeX, \\mkern only accepts mu-units, and \\kern does not accept\n// mu-units.

This is done to\n//    achieve a stretchy image while avoiding distortion of arrowheads or\n//    brace corners.\n\n//    The inner SVG typically contains a very long (400 em) arrow.\n\n//    The outer SVG acts like a window that exposes only part of the inner SVG.\n//    The outer SVG will grow or shrink to match the dimensions set by CSS.\n\n//    The inner SVG always has a longer, thinner aspect ratio than the outer\n//    SVG. After the inner SVG fills 100% of the height of the outer SVG,\n//    there is a long arrow shaft left over. That left-over shaft is not shown.\n//    Instead, it is sliced off because the inner SVG is set to\n//    \"preserveAspectRatio='... slice'\".\n\n//    Thus, the reader sees an arrow that matches the subject matter width\n//    without distortion.\n\n//    Some functions, such as \\cancel, need to vary their aspect ratio. These\n//    functions do not get the nested SVG treatment.\n\n// Second Brush Stroke\n//    Low resolution monitors struggle to display images in fine detail.\n//    So browsers apply anti-aliasing. A long straight arrow shaft therefore\n//    will sometimes appear as if it has a blurred edge.\n\n//    To mitigate this, these SVG files contain a second \"brush-stroke\" on the\n//    arrow shafts. That is, a second long thin rectangular SVG path has been\n//    written directly on top of each arrow shaft. This reinforcement causes\n//    some of the screen pixels to display as black instead of the anti-aliased\n//    gray pixel that a  single path would generate. So we get arrow shafts\n//    whose edges appear to be sharper.\n\nvar svgPath = {\n    doubleleftarrow: \"<path d='M262 157\\nl10-10c34-36 62.7-77 86-123 3.3-8 5-13.3 5-16 0-5.3-6.7-8-20-8-7.3\\n
